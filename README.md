# TODDLE-Frontend-Task---Curriculum-Authoring-Tool
Created a platform that allows teachers to create curricula for a specific subject.
The subject of the curriculum is made up of

```
1. Chapters 1 
   - Headings 1
     - Subheadings 1
2. Chapters 2 
   - Headings 1
     - Subheading 1
     - Subheading 2
     
```

## Features

- Row actions: indent, outdent, and delete
- While deleting intending, etc., keep parent-child relationships between nodes. When you delete an element, for example, you should likewise delete its children.
- Each row's text should be modifiable in the same way that a text box is.
- Load/Save - Create and download a JSON output, as well as load the JSON to recreate the structure.
- There was no use of a backend.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for moving chapter headings and subheadings

## TODO
-  Nesting with *n* number of sub children
-  Testing
